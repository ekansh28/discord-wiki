## What is Ballscord?

**Ballscord** is a Discord server built on hatred, mental instability, racism, and cardinal sin‚Äîhated by many; loved by a dangerously unwell and psychopathic few. It's infamous for its problematic lore that has affected thousands, sparking community-wide meltdowns and allegedly attracting federal-level attention, from its toxicity from its more oldgen members, from the brain-deadness of it all, from the racism, transphobia, homophobia, etcetera, and from the fact that there are so many pedophiles who make alt accounts and try to get back in. (Seriously there's like 22 pedophiles and none of the minors they try to groom are attractive. I don't know what they see in them.)

## Server Lore

The history of **Ballscord Wiki** is a chaotic saga of growth, conflicts, and internet culture. Below are the defining chapters of the server's evolution. You can also read about it here on Ekansh's outdated website: https://www.geocities.ws/ballscord/pages/Lore/Lore.html

### Founding and Early Days
* **The Birth (2021)**: Founded by [[User:OwnerUsername|Ekansh]] and friends, the server began as a small community spun off from another group. Early experiments with vanity URLs (like "tech" and later "racism") attracted rapid‚Äîif unpredictable‚Äîgrowth.
* **The Promotion Boom**: A strategic advertisement in a larger server (Trollcord) brought an influx of members, though tensions arose with rival communities.

### Major Events
* **The Great Emoji War**: A conflict sparked by the removal of a popular emoji, leading to weeks of meme-fueled battles.
* **The Raid Era**: Organized raids on external platforms (e.g., YouTube, other servers) became a controversial tradition before Discord's moderation policies forced a shift.
* **The Vanity Struggles**: Repeated losses of the server's custom URL ("racism") led to negotiations, scams, and eventual recoveries‚Äîoften with help from allies like [[User:Ayato|Ayato]].

### Internal Conflicts
* **The Fake Server Incident**: A co-owner briefly created an unauthorized replica of the server, which was later reclaimed and shut down.
* **The Mod Revolt**: Demotions of inactive staff and a subsequent rebellion resulted in mass bans, followed by appeals and reintegration.
* **The NSFW Purge**: Channels like "brothel" were removed after repeated policy violations, prompting stricter moderation

### Modern Era
Despite bans, rebrands, and internal drama, the server endures as a hub for dark humor, nostalgia, and unpredictable camaraderie. Its lore remains a living document‚Äîoften absurd, occasionally heartfelt, and always evolving.
